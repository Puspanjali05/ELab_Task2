# 🧠 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is a part of the AI & ML Internship program. The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

---

## 📌 Objective

Understand the Titanic dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify key patterns, trends, and anomalies that influence survival.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Titanic Dataset**, downloaded from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## 📊 EDA Process

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Checked dataset shape, column types, and missing values.
- Handled nulls in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and skewness of numeric columns.
- Identified data distribution.

### 3. Visualizations
- Histograms and Boxplots for Age, Fare, Pclass, etc.
- Correlation Heatmap
- Survival analysis based on gender and passenger class.
- Pairplots for multivariate relationships.

### 4. Insights
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- Females had significantly higher survival rates.
- Fare is positively skewed; outliers exist.
- Age had minor skewness; children had better survival.
